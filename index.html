            <strong> What Is Ymir?</strong><br>
            According to the ancient Norse texts, Ymir was a giant who was created from the melting ice of the realm
            of Niflheim, and he is considered the ancestor of all giants. Ymir was killed by Odin, VÃ© and Vili. From
            Ymir's body was used by the gods to create the world, including the land, sea, mountains, sky, stars,
            and the world of humans. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ymir">Read More...</a>

        <h3>Who am I...</h3>

        <p>My journey in the tech world started with a passion for science and genetics. I studied this fascinating
            field in university and started working as a content manager at a live-streaming company. But, as much as I
            enjoyed my job, I wanted to challenge myself and learn something new.</p>

        <p>That's when I decided to dive into the world of coding. I started with Python, a great language to begin
            with. It allowed me to develop basic coding skills and build some small projects. As I continued to learn, I
            found myself developing a keen interest in web development.</p>

        <p>Learning to code has been a thrilling experience for me. I've loved the process of writing code and seeing my
            projects come to life. The endless possibilities and the opportunity to create something new and valuable
            from scratch have been incredibly rewarding. I'm also excited to be part of the coding community, attending
            workshops, and joining online communities to connect with other like-minded individuals.</p>
        <p>As I continue on this coding journey, I'm grateful for the opportunities that coding has opened up for me. It
            has given me a competitive edge in my career and has taught me valuable problem-solving skills and a new way
            of thinking. I can't wait to see where this journey takes me next, and I'm excited for the new opportunities
            that lie ahead. ðŸ˜‰</p>
